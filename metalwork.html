        <p>This page is an overwiew of the metalwork I did throughout the course</p>
        <h2>The Initials</h2>
        <p>The Initials is the first metalworking project that I did in the metal shop.</p>
        <img src="img/initials.jpg" height="300">
        <h3>Materials</h3>
        <p>- The initals are made out of 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch steel rods from the metal rack.</p>
        <p>- I tried to only use materials from the rack, as they are from different projects and it's good to reuse.</p>

        <p>- I picked pieces that had minimal rust on it, so they would be easy to weld</p>
        
        <h3>Making the initials</h3>
        <p>- First, I had to make the base using bench tools, which I welded to make a perfect circle </p>
        <p>- I then created the letters one piece at a time by carefully cutting and shaping them with various bench tools then welding them together</p>
        <p>- Finally, I welded everything together and filed everything down.</p>
        <h2>The ironman</h2>
        <p>The ironman is the big metalworking project that we worked on in tech class using many machines in the metal shop</p>

        <h3>Making the ironman</h3>
        <p>Making the ironman different as this was the first project where I could choose exactly what I wanted to do and what to use for it.</p>
        <p>- I first brainstormed with 3 thumbnail drawings and eventually selected one that I liked</p>
        <img src="img/ironmandrawing.png">
        <p>- Then, I started selecting materials, I chose to try and only use items from the rack and not use new rods from the back of the shop to 
             which is better for the enviroment.
        </p>
        <p>I chose a random plate, a square pipe cut into a triangular shape, a square metal beam and quarter/eigth inch rods for my materials.</p>
        <p>I started by welding my square pipe piece onto my base with two litte welds, then a long one. This would act as my diving block</p>
        <p>Next, I filed and welded my square beam onto the base, but I filled the top with a round file so that there would be an indent for the body</p>
        <p>I then created my body with a cut from the round pipe, and a few quarter and eighth inch steel rods. </p>
        <p>Finally, I welded the whole body together, figured out the balance on the base, and filed everything down.</p>

        <h3>CAD</h3>
        <p>After I was done making my real irnoman, I CADded it on onshape which</p>
