        <p>This page is an overwiew of the metalwork I did throughout the course</p>
        <h2>The Initials</h2>
        <p>The Initials is the first metalworking project that I did in the metal shop.</p>
        <img src="img/initials.jpg" height="300">
        <h3>Materials</h3>
        <p>- The initals are made out of 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch steel rods from the metal rack.</p>
        <p>- I tried to only use materials from the rack, as they are from different projects and it's good to reuse.</p>

        <p>- I picked pieces that had minimal rust on it, so they would be easy to weld</p>
        
        <h3>Making the initials</h3>
        <p>- First, I had to make the base using bench tools, which I welded to make a perfect circle </p>
        <p>- I then created the letters one piece at a time by carefully cutting and shaping them with various bench tools then welding them together</p>
        <p>- Finally, I welded everything together and filed everything down.</p>
        <h2>The ironman</h2>
        <p>The ironman is the big metalworking project that we worked on in tech class using many machines in the metal shop</p>
