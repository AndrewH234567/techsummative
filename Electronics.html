          <h1>Electronics</h1>
          <p>During the electronics unit, I built circuits on tinkercad and in real life. I also coded these circuits to do different things such as morse code or follow the pentiometer. Each one was called a "circuit task"</p>

          <h3>Assorted circuits</h3>
          <img src="img/ct1.png">
          <p>This circuit task was just an introduction to get to know all the circuit type. I also built a parrelel circuit in real life.</p>

          <h3>Dimmable LED</h3>
          <img src="img/ct2.png">
          <p>This circuit task was to build a circuit in which you could dim and brighten an LED by adjusting the petentiometer. I built this in real life.</p>

          <h3>RGB LED</h3>
          <img src="img/ct3.png">
          <p>This circuit task is where I built a circuit with three petentiometers with 1 RGB LED, and each petentiometer adjusts a different colour. I built this circuit in real life.</p>

          <h3>Morse Code</h3>
          <p>I sadly don't have an image for this one, but this task was just coding an led to blink something in morse code. I used the word "skibidi"</p>

          <h3>Chaser lights</h3>
          <img src="img/ct5.png">
          <p>This one was by far the hardest, where I had to code and build a circuit in which when you turned the petentiometer, the chaser lights get faster/slower.</p>
