          <h1>Technical drawings and onshape</h1>
          <p>Throughout my entire time in Gr 9 Tech, I used onshape througout practically the whole course. This is an overview of all the onshape I did throughout the course.</p>
          
          <h2>Learning to cad</h2>
          <p>At the start of the year, I had no CAD experience, and I learned how to CAD throughout many tutorials, here are a few examples </p>

            CAD and Drawings in projects
          </h2>
          <p>After I learned CAD, I used it in virtually all of my projects afterwards</p>
          <h3>The tool tote</h3>

          <img src="img/toteonshapedrawing.png">
          <p>Though the CAD that I did in the end wasn't too useful, the drawing of the CAD that was given was how I got my measurements.</p>
          <h3>The IronMan</h3>
          <img src="img/ironmaniso.png">
          <p>I cadded my whole ironman project after I was done</p>
          <p>This was a bit tricky as I had a lot of trouble with the ironman's body itself, and</p>
          <p>the triangular part of the base took a while to figure out, I had to do some weird extrudes and fillets, but</p>
          <p>eventually, I got it done.</p>

          <h3>The Boardgame</h3>
          <p>I didn't use the 3d printer for this project, however, I did do laser cutting which I used onshape for.</p>

          <p>These two versions of trees were game elements for our board game</p>

          <p>My whole launcher was cadded on onshape.</p>
