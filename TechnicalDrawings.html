            <h1>Technical drawings and onshape</h1>
            <p>Throughout my entire time in Gr 9 Tech, I used onshape throughout practically the whole course. This is an overview of all the onshape I did throughout the course.</p>
            
            <h2>Learning to CAD</h2>
            <p>At the start of the year, I had no CAD experience, and I learned how to CAD throughout many tutorials, here are a few examples:</p>
            
            <!-- Image Grid -->
            <div class="image-grid">
                <div class="image-item">

            <h2>CAD and Drawings in Projects</h2>
            <p>After I learned CAD, I used it in virtually all of my projects afterwards.</p>
            <h3>The Tool Tote</h3>
            <img src="img/totecad.png" alt="Tote CAD">
            <img src="img/toteonshapedrawing.png" alt="Tote Onshape Drawing">
            <p>Though the CAD that I did in the end wasn't too useful, the drawing of the CAD that was given was how I got my measurements.</p>
            <h3>The IronMan</h3>
            <img src="img/ironmaniso.png" alt="IronMan ISO">
            <p>I CADed my whole IronMan project after I was done.</p>
            <p>This was a bit tricky as I had a lot of trouble with the IronMan's body itself, and the triangular part of the base took a while to figure out. I had to do some weird extrudes and fillets, but eventually, I got it done.</p>

            <h3>The Boardgame</h3>
            <p>I didn't use the 3D printer for this project; however, I did do laser cutting, which I used Onshape for.</p>
            <img src="img/tree1.png" alt="Tree 1">
            <img src="img/tree2.png" alt="Tree 2">
            <p>These two versions of trees were game elements for our board game.</p>
            <h3>The Nerf Dart Launcher</h3>
            <img src="img/nerfCadiso.png" alt="Nerf CAD ISO">
            <img src="img/nerfCadDrawing.png" alt="Nerf CAD Drawing">
            <p>My whole launcher was CADed on Onshape.</p>

            <h2>Technical Drawings</h2>
            <h3>The IronMan Project</h3>
            <img src="img/ironmandrawing.png" alt="IronMan Drawing">
            <p>This drawing consists of 3 thumbnail drawings of ideas, which I chose one from, then added detailed measurements to.</p>
            <h3>The Nerf Dart Launcher</h3>
            <a href="nerfdart.html">[see nerf dart launcher page]</a>
            <h3>Other Projects</h3>
            <p>Sadly, I wasn't able to find any other paper drawings of my other projects, Boardgame and Initials.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, Onshape has helped me communicate most of my drawings to you through Classroom, making my ideas easier to show to others so that they can get a clear picture of what I'm trying to do.</p>
            <p>Onshape, CAD, and VCarve have all made it so easy to design what I'm thinking, and they're all much more exact than any drawing I would have made on paper, which is extremely useful because you can see exactly what you're going to make.</p>
            <p>These technologies have also made it extremely easy to just click export and send a file to the laser cutter, CNC machine, 3D printer, etc., which definitely wouldn't be possible without them.</p>
