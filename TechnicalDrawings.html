          <h1>Technical drawings and onshape</h1>
          <p>Throughout my entire time in Gr 9 Tech, I used onshape througout practically the whole course. This is an overview of all the onshape I did throughout the course.</p>
          
          <h2>Learning to cad</h2>
          <p>At the start of the year, I had no CAD experience, and I learned how to CAD throughout many tutorials, here are a few examples </p>

            CAD and Drawings in projects
          </h2>
          <p>After I learned CAD, I used it in virtually all of my projects afterwards</p>
          <h3>The tool tote</h3>
          <img src="img/totecad.png">
          <img src="img/toteonshapedrawing.png">
          <p>Though the CAD that I did in the end wasn't too useful, the drawing of the CAD that was given was how I got my measurements.</p>
          <h3>The IronMan</h3>
          <img src="img/ironmaniso.png">
          <p>I cadded my whole ironman project after I was done, which was a bit tricky because the metal pieces were bent and were pretty weird, but I got it done in the end</p>
          <h3>The Boardgame</h3>
          <p>I didn't use the 3d printer for this project, however, I did do laser cutting which I used onshape for.</p>

          <p>These two versions of trees were game elements for our board game</p>

Give examples of how technology has helped you design/communicate/build. -->
