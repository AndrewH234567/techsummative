          <h1>Teamwork</h1>
          <p>The group project we did this semester was the Board Game project, Ecologically aware monkeys.</p>
          <img src="adwawddawdaw">
          <p>For this project, I was the person responsible for the laser cutter.</p>
          <h3>The trees</h3>
          <p>For this part of the board game project I was meant to make many small trees for the map, which I did using onshape and sending the svg to the laser cutter</p>
          <img src="img/tree1.png">
          <img src="img/tree2.png">
          <p>I ended up picking a piece thin wood board to laser cut it on.</p>
          <h3>Currency, Bananas and Seashells</h3>
          <p>I made 3 types of tokes for this boardgame using the lasercutter/engraver, </p>
          <p>- Resource points</p>
          <p>- Bananas</p>
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>- I found that my measurements in onshape for the thickness of the material was wrong, so my first few trees were not cut deep enough</p>
          <p>- </p>
