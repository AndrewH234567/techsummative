          <h1>Teamwork</h1>
          <p>The group project we did this semester was the Board Game project, Ecologically aware monkeys.</p>
          <img src="img/IMG_7915.png">
          <p>For this project, I was the person responsible for the laser cutter.</p>
          <h3>The trees</h3>
          <p>For this part of the board game project I was meant to make many small trees for the map, which I did using onshape and sending the svg to the laser cutter</p>
          <img src="img/tree1.png">
          <img src="img/tree2.png">
          <p>I ended up picking a piece thin wood board to laser cut it on. </p>
          <h3>Currency, Bananas and Seashells</h3>
          <p>I made 3 types of tokes for this boardgame using the lasercutter/engraver, </p>
          <p>- Resource points</p>
          <img src="img/andrew-currency-engrave.jpg">
          <p>- Bananas</p>
          <img src="img/banana.jpg">
          <p>- Seashells</p>
          <img src="img/seashell.jpg">
          <p>I got the engraving design on top of these coins from Bryan, which I converted to a jpg and put it on the software/</p>
          <p>The way I made these was I cadded a circle on onshape that would be the outer ring, then engraved the pictures in the middle of the circles.</p>
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>- I found that my measurements in onshape for the thickness of the piece were slightly incorrect so it was extremely difficult to push the pieces out, but I fixed this in the end by running the laser twice.</p>
          <p>- The software for the laser cutter was pretty hard to use, lining up the coins and the circle was pretty difficult, so when I finished one, I just arrayed all of the other ones.</p>
          <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
          <p>This was a really fun project, I liked working with others, this made the project much easier to do, and much more fun.</p>
          <p>I enjoyed working on</p>
