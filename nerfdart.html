<h1>Nerf Dart Project</h1>
<p>This is the first part of the summative in which I built a nerf dart launcher that is capable of shooting a nerf dart to 8 ft, and the launcher can adjust for windage and elecation</p>

<!--prob add the above side by side or maybe not idk (also resize the dart picture way too big)-->
<!--also nerflaunch.jpg isn't working-->
<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
<p>At the start of this project, I came up with three ideas in the form of thumbnail sketches, in which I chose one that I thought was the best in the end.</p>

<h4>Idea 1</h4>
<img src="img/nerfidea1.png">
<p>The idea to this example is that it is rather simple, with one key mechanism, a round handle that can be pulled over set positions to set the power. </p>

<h4>Idea 2</h4>
<img src="img/nerfidea2.png">
<p>For this idea, it doesn't have set power but instead had a different handle with a bar for setting elevation.</p>

<h4>Idea 3</h4>
<img src="img/nerfidea3.png">
<p>In this thumbnail, I took general ideas from all the other ones and put it into one, with a set power using holes in the dowel where you can put a 
    pin through. It also has a set elevation and set windage using different techniques. This is the design that I ended up picking

<h2>Building the nerf dart launcher</h2>
<!--talk about the challenges i faced-->
<p>Building this nerf dart launcher was in someways easy and also in some ways hard, there were many challenges throughout building the nerf dart launcher.
</p>


<p>- First, I had to make the default barrel, in which I would build off of. This was just 4 pieces that I cut with the compound mitre saw then routed and glued together</p>
<p>- Next, I created the handle, which I made out of a rectangular piece of wood that I cut off with the compound mitre saw, then drill pressed and glued to my dowel </p>
<p>I then </p>


<h3>Machines</h3>
<!--make it easier/cheaper/faster/safer-->
<p>rizzy rizzards with rizz made my life easier</p>

<h3>Materials, Sustainability and Reusing</h3>
<!--Why is it a good adiea to minimize material waste? What did/could you do to minimize material waste-->
<!--What materials did you work with? How did you choose materials and what was your reasoning-->
<p>Tonight on smnn</p>

<h3>CAD 3d modeling</h3>
<p>I did CADding for this project with onshape and I chose to do this skibidi rizz sigma gyatt ohio in rizzy town sigma rizz</p>
