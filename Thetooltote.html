    <h1>The Tool Tote</h1>
    <img src="img/toteimage.jpg" height="300">
    <p>The tool tote project is the first project that I created in Gr 9 tech. It uses many machines and tools in the wood shop as well as the CNC machine, so this was a really good first project. </p>
    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <p>The plan for this project was already given from the form of an onshape drawing, and I just had to measure all the pieces corectly according to the drawing</p>
    <img src="img/toteonshapedrawing.png">

    <h2>Materials</h2>
        -3/4 inch thick pine wood<br>
        -3/16 inch thick hardboard<br>
        -Wood screws<br>
        -Dowels<br>
    <p>The materials for this project were already set for this project</p>

    <h2>Machines</h2>

      -Compound mitre saw<br>
      -Band saw<br>
      -Drill press<br>
      -Router table<br>
      -Drill<br>
      -Table saw w DADO stack<br>
      -CNC machine<br>
      -Sanders<br>
      -The nail gun<br>


    <p>
      It would also be extremely hard to make a hole as good as the drill press, and if it were possible it would definately take much longer than the drill press.
    </p>
    <p> 
      I also could not do the grooves without the router table, it is definately better in most ways, faster easier and cheaper. 
  
    </p>

    <h2>Making the tool tote</h2>
    <p>
    First, we got on V-carve and designed our name/design for the 12 inch piece that we were going to carve with the large CNC machine. I designed my name with 2 skibidi toilet pictures beside my name.
    </p>
    <p>
    We then cut our 12 inch pieces with the compound miter saw, and Mr Heidt did the CNC shortly after. For my piece though, only one skibidi toilet came out, and it stayed like that for a whole week before Mr Heidt recarved it which was pretty funny.
    </p>
    <p>
    Next, I did the “triangle ends” with 7 by 7 boards made out of pine, first cutting it to a square with the compound miter saw, then cutting the corners and the handle attachment with the bandsaw. It went pretty well, though it was a little slow, so in the meantime I used the table saw to cut the ends of the 12 inch boards (this was still before the 2nd skibidi toilet was cut)
    </p>
    <p>
    I then drilled the pieces for the screws later on with drills and countersink.
    </p>
    <p>
    Next, I assembled the 4 pieces together with the 90 degree glue up jig and clamps. The second 12 inch boards and 7 inch connected pretty well though I had to use sandpaper to wedge in. When it was time to put everything together, I kind of messed up and only glued one side, so I kind of had to pry the other side open to glue it and screw it. I screwed a few of them too much, and it split the wood slightly, which I glued, but you can still somewhat see it if you look closely.
    </p>
    <p>
    For putting the handle on, I used A LOT of sandpaper, files and rasps, as my 7 inch boards were just a little too narrow to fit it in. I used the drill press to drill the holes for the handles, though I drilled a hole a little too close to the inner edge of the tote. I then glued it on, and screwed it in. There was a little gap under and beside the handles on both sides, which I filled in with just glue and sanded it, as I liked the look better than glue mixed with sawdust.
    </p>
    <p>
    The caps for the screw holes on the handle was sanded, and I liked mine a little longer, you can see it sticks out a little further than most people. 
    </p>
    <p>
    After that, I got the board for the bottom, which I cut with the compound miter saw. My router table edges were a little weird, so I did have to sand those down, but after a while I managed to glue it to the tote, and secure it with the air nailer
    </p>
    <p>
    Then I sanded the whole project A LOT, and filled in some gaps, and that was basically it.

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>There were quite a few challenges during this project, which include</p>
    <p>- When I was gluing my 4 pieces, I only applied glue on one side, so I had to pry the wood a bit to get the other glue on</p>
    <p>- The CNC machine did not work properly, I'm not too sure what happened, but it turned out okay in the end.</p>
    <p>- The indents that the router table cut were pretty weird and not correct, so I had to sand those down a lot</p>

    <h2>How changes have technological innovations had on me and/or society in general?</h2>
    <p>There were many changes in technological innovation such as the compound mitre saw, which is extremely important to cutting wood. I think without the compound mitre saw
      or similar machines, you would have to cut wood by hand, which is really ineficient. It's much more imprecise, which I can see myself, I used the bandsaw for the tote, and
      for the nerf dart I did it without machines, and it not only was a less clean cut with more splinters, but it took much longer. With my own experience, technological innovations
      have had a big impact on me, most of my projects would not be possible without them. The compound mitre saw would also be much safer, as you always know where the blade comes down,
      so you don't have to worry too much about that, and you could focus more on where your hand is. 
        </p>


    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p>This was my first woodworking project, so this is where I learned how to use most of the machines in the wood shop.
       I also learned about cleaning up, and where everything is in the woodshop.
       The tool tote also showed me many shop skills and rules such as cleanup and where everything goes.
